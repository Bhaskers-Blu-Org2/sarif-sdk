# Rules and Guidelines for producing high-quality SARIF output

## Introduction

This document is for creators of static analysis tools who want to produce the best possible SARIF output.

Teams can use SARIF log files in many ways. They can view the results in an IDE extension such as the [SARIF extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-SarifVSCode.sarif-viewer) or the [SARIF Viewer VSIX for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WDGIS.MicrosoftSarifViewer), or in a [web-based viewer](https://microsoft.github.io/sarif-web-component/). They can import it into a static analysis results database, or use it to drive automatic bug fiing. Most important, developers use the information in a SARIF log file to understand and fix the problems it reports.

The [SARIF specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html) defines dozens of objects with hundreds of properties. It can be hard to decide which ones are important (aside from the few that the spec says are mandatory). What information is most helpful to developers? What information should you include if you want to file useful bugs from the SARIF log?

On top of all that, the spec is written in format language that's hard to read. If you want to learn SARIF, take a look at the [SARIF Tutorials](https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-tutorials).

The purpose of this document is to cut through the confusion and provide clear guidance on what information your tool should include in a SARIF file, and how to make that information as helpful and usable as possible.

### Structural requirements

Many of SARIF's structural requirements are expressed in a [JSON schema](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/os/schemas/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json), but the schema can't express all the structural requirements. In addition to providing helpful, useful information, it's important for tools to produce SARIF that meet all the structural requirements, even the ones that the schema can't express.

### The SARIF validation tool

The SARIF validation tool (the "validator") helps ensure that a SARIF file conforms to SARIF's structural requirements as well as to the guidelines for producing high-quality SARIF output.

#### What the validator does

Here's how the validator process a SARIF log file:

1. If the file is not valid JSON, report the syntax error and stop.
2. If the file does not conform to the SARIF schema, report the schema violations and stop.
3. Run a set of analysis rules. Report any rule violations.

The analysis rules in Step 3 fall into two categories:

1. Rules that detect structural problems that the schema can't express.
2. Rules that enforce guidelines for producing high quality SARIF.

The validator is incomplete: it does not enforce every structural condition in the spec, nor every guideline for producing high quality SARIF. We hope to continue to add analysis rules in both those areas.

#### Installing and using the validator

To install the validator, run the command
```
dotnet tool install Sarif.Multitool --global
```
Now you can validate a SARIF file by running the command
```
sarif validate MyFile.sarif --output MyFile-validation.sarif
```
The SARIF Multitool can do many things besides validate a SARIF file (that's why it's called the "MultiTool"). To see what it can do, just run the command
```
sarif
```

### How this document is organized

This document expresses each structural requirement and guideline as a SARIF analysis rule. At the time of this writing, not all of those rules actually exist. Those that do not are labled "(NYI)".

We first present the rules that detect serious violations of the SARIF spec (rules which validator would report as `"error"`). They have numbers in the range 1000-1999, for example, `SARIF1001.RuleIdentifiersMustBeValid`.

Then come the rules that detect either less serious violations of the SARIF spec (rules which the validator would report as `"warning"` or `"note"`). They have numbers in the range 2000-2999, for example, `SARIF2001.AuthorHighQualityMessages`.

Each analysis rule has a description that describes the purpose of the rule, followed by one or more messages that can appear in a SARIF result object that reports a violtion of this rule.

## Rules that describe serious violations

Rules that describe violations of **SHALL**/**SHALL NOT** requirements of the [SARIF specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/os/sarif-v2.1.0-os.html) have numbers between 1000 and 1999, and always have level `"error"`.

### Rule `SARIF1001.RuleIdentifiersMustBeValid`

#### Description

SARIF rules have two identifiers. The required 'id' property must be a "stable, opaque identifier" (the SARIF specification ([ยง3.49.3](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/os/sarif-v2.1.0-os.html#_Toc34317839)) explains the reasons for this). The optional 'name' property ([ยง3.49.7](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/os/sarif-v2.1.0-os.html#_Toc34317843)) is an identifer that is understandable to an end user. Therefore if both 'id' and 'name' are present, they must be different. If both 'name' and 'id' are opaque identifiers, omit the 'name' property. If both 'name' and 'id' are human-readable identifiers, then consider assigning an opaque identifier to each rule, but in the meantime, omit the 'name' property.

#### Messages

##### `Default`: error

{0}: The rule '{1}' has a 'name' property that is identical to its 'id' property. The required 'id' property must be a "stable, opaque identifier" (the SARIF specification ([ยง3.49.3](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/os/sarif-v2.1.0-os.html#_Toc34317839)) explains the reasons for this). The optional 'name' property ([ยง3.49.7](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/os/sarif-v2.1.0-os.html#_Toc34317843)) is an identifer that is understandable to an end user. Therefore if both 'id' and 'name' are present, they must be different.

# Rules that describe less serious violations

Rules that describe violations of **SHOULD**/**SHOULD NOT** requirements of the [SARIF specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/os/sarif-v2.1.0-os.html) have numbers between 2000 and 2999, and always have level `"warning"`.

Rules that describe violations of SARIF recommendations or best practices also have numbers in this range. Some of those recommendations are expressed in the spec as **MAY** requirements; others are based on experience using the format. These rules have level `"warning"` or `"note"`, depending on the tool's opinion of the seriousness of the violation.

## Rule `SARIF2009.UseConventionalSymbolicNames`

### Description

SARIF uses symbolic names in various contexts. This rule proposes uniform naming conventions for the various types of symbolic names.

Many tools follow a conventional format for the 'reportingDescriptor.id' property: a short string identifying the tool concatenated with a numeric rule number,
for example, 'CS2001' for a diagnostic from the Roslyn C# compiler. For uniformity of experience across tools, we recommend this format.

Many tool use similar names for 'uriBaseId' symbols. We suggest 'REPOROOT' for the root of a repository, 'SRCROOT' for the root of the directory containing all source code, 'TESTROOT' for the root of the directory containing all test code (if your repository is organized in that way), and 'BINROOT' for the root of the directory containing build output (if your project places all build output in a common directory).

### Messages

#### `UseConventionalRuleIds`: note

{0}: The 'name' property ' of the rule '{1}' does not follow the recommended format: a short string identifying the tool concatenated with a numeric rule number, for example, `CS2001`. Using a conventional format for the rule id provides a more uniform experience across tools.

#### `UseConventionalUriBaseIdNames`: note

{0}: The 'originalUriBaseIds' symbol '{1}' is not one of the conventional symbols. We suggest 'REPOROOT' for the root of a repository, 'SRCROOT' for the root of the directory containing all source code, 'TESTROOT' for the root of the directory containing all test code (if your repository is organized in that way), and 'BINROOT' for the root of the directory containing build output (if your project places all build output in a common directory).
